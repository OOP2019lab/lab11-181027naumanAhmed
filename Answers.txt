Exericse 6:

a)
The reason age member variable is made protected is so that the base class and inherited class can modify it and use it only through public functions. (In public & protected Inheritance)
Unlike private variables which cant be accessed by inherited class. (In all kinds of Inheritance)

b)
Errors are:
first_name is not defined
last_name is not defined

c)
We get these errors because first_name and last_name are private variables and they cant be accessed in inherited class.



Exerice 8 and 9:

There is no effect in changing the inheritance type from public to private or protected because we are not accessing the private members of base class.
